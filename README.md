# 1-Dollar-Unistroke-Recogniser
The $1 Unistroke Recognizer implementation in Python with a GUI wrapper made in Kivy

The $1 Unistroke Recognizer is a 2-D single-stroke recognizer designed for rapid prototyping of gesture-based user interfaces. In machine learning terms, $1 is an instance-based nearest-neighbor classifier with a 2-D Euclidean distance function, i.e., a geometric template matcher.
